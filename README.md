## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Alice Gonzalez**, and I am pursuing a degree in **Computer Information Systems** at **Baruch College**, with a minor in **Information Technology and Social Responsibility**. As part of my team, SLR, I was honored to win [HackPrinceton's Best Accessibility Hack](https://devpost.com/software/slr-sign-language-rocks) for developing a machine learning model that translates sign language to text in real time. 

After this initial exposure to machine learning, I decided to further my education in the field by joining the [Break Through Tech AI Program](https://tech.cornell.edu/impact/break-through-tech/break-through-ai/). Through their summer course, I gained the skills to address real-world machine learning challenges, becoming proficient in building, deploying, and managing ML models using Python. This experience culminated in earning a Machine Learning Certificate from Cornell University.

After completing the course, I advanced to the AI Studio, where I tackled a project challenge presented by Allstate. The task involved developing a machine learning model to predict a customer's final claim cost using actual customer data.
